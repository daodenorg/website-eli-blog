## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
│   ├── admin/
│   │   └── config.yml  # CMS configuration
│   └── uploads/        # Media uploads from CMS
├── src/
│   ├── components/     # Astro components
│   ├── content/        # Blog posts and content
│   ├── layouts/        # Page layouts
│   └── pages/
│       ├── admin/      # CMS admin interface
│       └── blog/       # Blog post routes
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## 📝 CMS Access

The admin interface is available at `/admin`. You need to set up authentication:

### For Netlify Deployment

1. Connect your site to Netlify
2. Enable Identity service in Netlify dashboard
3. Enable Git Gateway for CMS access
4. Set registration to invite-only for security

### For GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Configure with a Netlify site for authentication only
2. Set up GitHub Actions for deployment to GitHub Pages
3. Use Netlify Identity for admin access

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages

- The GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on push
- Make sure to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings

### Netlify

- Connect your repository to Netlify
- Netlify will automatically detect the build settings
- Enable Identity service for CMS authentication
